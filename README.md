### your computer
download the roblox-rpc executable from [releases](https://github.com/itspeasoup/studio-rpc/releases). since roblox studio is for windows and mac (idk who uses roblox studio on a mac), you can download one of those.

after its downloaded, just launch it!

## weird stuff
if you don't see any activity on your discord profile, try running it as administrator.
